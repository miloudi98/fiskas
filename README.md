## This will be rewritten! new version can be found here: https://github.com/miloudi98/x86_assembler

I will start rewriting once I finish my current university semester.
The rewrite is happening mainly because the code is currently a **mess**. I also now have a better understanding of how
x86 instructions are encoded.
